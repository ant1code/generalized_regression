## Worksheet 11

```{r}
data("CHFLS", package = "HSAUR2")
library("MASS")
polr.mod <- polr(R_happy ~ R_age + R_income, data = CHFLS)
summary(polr.mod)
```

In this model, we consider the odds of being higher than a certain category, as opposed to being lower than a certain cutpoint given age and income. 
For example, suppose we are interested in very happy, as opposed to somewhat happy. In this case, we take intercept 1.4127, betas stay the same (hence proportional (log)odds).
Lets say age == 30, income == 500.
log(OR) = 1.4127 -0.006279*30 + 500*0.000235 = 1.34
means: logs odds of being very happy as opposed to happy are 13/10.
== odds are 3.82, being very happy is therefore pretty likely.

General Interpretation:
In all these cases, the odds of being in a higher category multiply by exp(-0.006279) for every increase in age and by exp(0.000235) for 1 increase in income - on average.
