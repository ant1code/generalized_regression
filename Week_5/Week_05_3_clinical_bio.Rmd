Celiac disease is a condition that impairs the ability of the gut to absorb nutrients. A useful measure of nutritional status is the biceps skinfold thickness, which has standard deviation 2.3 mm in this population. A new nutritional program is proposed and is to be compared with the present program. Suppose the two groups of equal size are compared at the 5% significance level.
