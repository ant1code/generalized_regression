## Problem 16

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(readr)
zurichtemp <- read_csv("http://user.math.uzh.ch/furrer/download/sta402mat924/zurichtemp.csv")
x <- zurichtemp$Temperature
hist(x)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
par_mu <- seq(-20, 20, length.out = 10000)
par_sd <- par_mu^2
likelihood <- numeric(length(par_mu))
start_par<- 15
my_likelihood <- function(par_mu) {
  sum(dnorm(x, mean = par_mu, sd = par_sd, log = TRUE))
}
opt <-optim(start_par, function(par_mu) {sum(dnorm(x, mean = par_mu, sd = par_sd, log = TRUE))}, 
            control = list(fnscale = -1), method = "BFGS",
            hessian = TRUE)
opt$par
```

For some reason, it outputs value of 11.61, which can't be correct, but I don't see where is my mistake.
```{r}
y <- rnorm(seq(0,100, length = 10000), opt$par, (opt$par)^2)
hy <- hist(y, plot = FALSE)
hx <- hist(x, plot = FALSE)
plot(hx, col = "blue")
plot(hy, col = "red")
```

```{r}
plot(hy, col = "red")
z<- dnorm(y, mean=11.60666, sd=134.715)
plot(y,z, add = TRUE)

y <- rnorm(seq(0,100, length = 100), opt$par, (opt$par)^2)
z<- dnorm(y, mean=11.60666, sd=134.715)
plot(y,z)
```
d) Should be that the higher the n in c is, the smaller is the derivation at l(theta).
